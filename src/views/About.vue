                  World-class public transport is the key to driving our region forward, while tackling the
                  climate emergency and air pollution. The Metro Futures programme will see more than £500m
                  invested by Nexus in the next five years on projects which will benefit the North East’s people
                  and economy for decades to come. The key parts of Metro Futures are:

                      A new Metro fleet which will transform the journey experience, be 20 times more reliable but
                      use 30% less energy than current trains.

                    <li>
                      The £104m Metro Flow project, upgrading lines to make trains more frequent, create space for
                      up to 30,000 more passengers and deliver smoother and shorter journey times.

                      Continued investment in Metro’s behind-the-scenes technology and infrastructure including
                      power lines, track and signal systems.

                <p>
                  Construction of the Tyne and Wear Metro began in 1974, and the first part of the system opened in
                  1980. It has since extended in stages to North and South Shields, to Newcastle Airport and
                  through Sunderland. Metro has been at the cutting edge in providing access for all, smoke-free
                  travel and mobile phone access, among other innovations. For further information about Metro's
                  history, see the <a target="blank" href="https://www.nexus.org.uk/history">history

                <p>
                  There are few people living in Tyne and Wear whose daily lives are not touched in some way by
                  Nexus. It might be getting you to work, or taking the children to school. It might be treating
                  you to a day out shopping or a family trip to the coast or a museum. It might be helping you
                  enjoy a night out on the town without worrying who will be driving home.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Over the last decade, Stadler’s presence in the UK has grown dramatically. Fifty-eight new FLIRT
                  trains for Greater Anglia are currently being rolled out in East Anglia, and over the coming
                  months, 52 METRO trains will start entering passenger service in the Liverpool City Region.
                  Within a couple of years, 17 METRO trains will be introduced on Glasgow Subway. Seventy-one
                  trains for Wales & Borders will start replacing the old fleet from 2022. Earlier this year,
                  Nexus awarded Stadler the contract to provide 42 new METRO trains for the Tyne and Wear Metro.
                  Seven Class 399 Citylink tram-trains were delivered to Sheffield in 2017 and Variobahns have
                  been running on Tramlink in Croydon since 2011. Class 68 and 88 locomotives are already
                  well-established work-horses on the UK rail network. Stadler has Service contracts in place in
                  Liverpool and Norwich, employing 250 people at these locations in total. In October 2020, a
                  further 120 people will transfer to Stadler from Nexus.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The contract that Nexus awarded to Stadler in January 2020 comprises 42 new METRO trains, a new
                  depot and the provision of service and maintenance of the trains for 35 years. Carriages will be
                  bright and open, with multi-functional areas for wheelchairs, prams, luggage and bicycles. They
                  will be air-conditioned throughout and newly developed air-sprung bogies will reduce noise.
                  Eight large double doors will allow passengers to get on and off quickly. Trains will feel more
                  secure, featuring CCTV for door operation and clear warning displays. Power will be supplied via
                  an overhead line with 1500 V DC. Maximum speed will be 80 kilometres per hour. The lightweight
                  vehicle design, the recovery of braking energy and the use of highly efficient traction
                  converter technology will lower energy consumption, underscoring Stadler’s commitment to green
                  technology. Trains will be built to include an energy storage system at a later date, so that
                  they will be able to operate on an extended network, in future.
