      "Still not very family friendly. More needs to be put in place for safeguarding and to make sure you get the space you require with a buggy",
      "The designated buggy space is good, as is the marker on the relevant door. Other elements are not so good.",
      "There are so many doors, there is a higher risk of the toddler running away, plus there is no 2+1 facing seats so she cant pull up the pushchair next to some seats for a rest without getting in the way"

      "Non-folding bikes are not compatible with crowded carriages and busy stations",
      "wifi is good to keep amused on long journeys. bikes much better than current trains. not really any disadvantages for sanjeev",

      "Better visual displays than current trains. Simpler layout / less things to bump in to.",
      "Colours help separate different features of the train rather than everything blending into one.",
      "I love all of the accessibility features in the new trains and I hope they all get implemented.",
      "Perhaps stripes on the poles to help it stand out more. Clear display board and plenty of open room",

      "The step idea is amazing! My mother is in a wheelchair and I travel with her often on the metro its great to see that these things are being taken into consideration!",
      "Wheelchair space clearly marked on doors... could be better on floor marking . Button might be wrong position for someone in wheelchair"

      "There needs to be some sort of system or way of Mary being able to guarantee a priority seat, rather than having to find another because people are already sat there",
      "she was reassured by the cctv however, it  could say what to to do if people are very rowdy, aggressive or rude, does Mary know you can report an incident?",
      "Like the security cameras and the information screen as well as the door with the noise to remind you to press the button",
