      {text: "I walk along the coast to get to the Metro in the morning. It’s usually very cold and this morning it’s absolutely freezing! I've got music and PE today, so I've got tons of stuff to carry – PE kit, saxophone and school bag! It takes me ten minutes to walk to the Metro station. I like getting to school 'bang on time' so, I get the train just after 7 am. I know exactly where to stand—and on a good day it goes exactly as planned—next to the second piece of glass at the station. When the Metro arrives, it’s quite busy. It looks like there are still a few seats left, but I stand in the multi-purpose space for my journey, rather than sit between people."},
      {text: "I lean against the edge of the divider and wedge my bags between my legs and the edge of the train. I stand on the right-hand side so that I don' t get in the way of passengers getting on and off."},
      {text: "The journey takes half an hour, so I use my phone to message my friends and listen to music. My friend Molly messages me to say she’s on her Metro. I like to know the progress of my journey - it looks like I've just left Monument."},
      {text: "I start getting all my stuff together. There are some older boys trying to act tough so, I concentrate on keeping an eye on my bags."},
      {text: "I like to get to the door before I'm getting to the stop to make sure I'm the first off, and I'm at the front of the queue."},
      {text: "There are staff checking tickets at Jesmond Metro station, which I always like. It’s good to know there’s someone there if I need a hand with anything. I show my Season Ticket to the staff on my way out and bump into Molly. It starts tipping it down as we walk the last few minutes to school together. We arrive just in time—but soaked!"},
